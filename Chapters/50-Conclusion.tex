\chapter{Conclusion}\label{cp:conclusion}

Based on the results of this initial weight and sizing, we have a much better sense of the shape and size of our \acrshort{uav}. We chose the \acrshort{naca} 4412 for our main wing airfoil and the \acrshort{naca} 0010 for the horizontal and vertical stabilizers. The weight and size of our aircraft leave plenty of headroom for batteries, motors, electronics, and additional payload components, which will be analyzed in closer detail in future trade studies. Additionally, we have three concept sketches that match our initial sizing estimates from which we can generate an initial \acrshort{cad} model.
