\chapter{Introduction}\label{cp:introduction}

The \acrfull{dhs} has contracted StratoShield to build an \acrfull{uav} capable of identifying and neutralizing hostile \acrfull{suas}. To satisfy this mission, StratoShield is designing an aircraft equipped with technology to jam \acrshort{suas} control signals. It will be capable of patrolling an \acrfull{aoi} for up to \qty{45}{\minute} while protecting a designated key area within the \acrshort{aoi}. The primary objective is to identify, track, and disable \acrshort{suas} threats through non-destructive electronic countermeasures.

This report includes initial estimates of the weight and size of StratoShield's \acrshort{uav}, code-named ``Banshee''. Additionally, several concept sketches and designs are discussed in \autoref{cp:concept_sketches}. These measurements and decisions are not final; rather, they are intended to provide the \acrfull{cad} engineers and design team with a more reasonable starting point. Additionally, starting with a more refined design also aims to reduce the number of design cycles required to meet the system requirements.
